Guidelines for execution:

1. Import the project in Eclipse/ Netbeans
2. I have provided some sample images. You can use your images too.
3. The main running code is "ImageHiding.java" inside src folder
4. The code need location of host image and Audio. Provide your location.
5. Execute "ImageAudioHiding.java" as Java Application


I have made a separate soundplayer.java file for reading the audio file and generate bits out of it.
